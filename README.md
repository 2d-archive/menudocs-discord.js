# Hello 👋🏽

> This is a repository for things I would do if I was doing the tutorials...

- [MenuDocs](https://menudocs.link/discord) ([website](https://menudocs.org))
- [Original Tutorials](https://github.com/MenuDocs/Discord.js-v12-Tutorials)

###### Differences

- I use Babel instead of regular javascript because I like import/export instead of require/module.exports
- There's `prettier` for formatting the code, with some changes to the eslint configuration because I like 2 spaces instead of tabs.
- A logger because colored logs are nice.
- Command ratelimiting because yeah.
- and module resolving because import paths get very long sometimes.

no license hehe.
